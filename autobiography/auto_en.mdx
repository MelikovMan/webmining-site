# Autobiography
## 1. Early Childhood
I was born in Uray on August 23, 2002. My mother's name is *Melikova Olga Nikolaevna*, and my father's name is *Melikov Magomed Gadzhievich*.
My parents loved me very much and encouraged my academic and other endeavors without excessive criticism, for which I am grateful to them. I remember very little of my life before the age of 4,
only that we moved from Uray to Tyumen, and then to Anapa. After moving to Anapa, I spent a long time studying with my grandmother *Margarita*. She taught me literacy,
drawing, and prepared me for school, since I didn't attend kindergarten; I socialized with peers outdoors. I was quite an active and talkative person until I contracted bilateral
pneumonia in childhood, which required me to take antibiotics for six months, after which I became an introvert, which I remain to this day.

## 2. School
I entered class "V" at school No. 6 in Anapa. My teacher was *Svetlana Elena Vasilievna*, and I have very good memories of her. From the very beginning, I studied diligently
and well, and I came to love learning. I persistently and faithfully completed my homework. When I entered middle school, my academic and general interests diversified greatly, and I constantly participated in Olympiads in various subjects - mathematics, physics,
geography, literature. My most successful Olympiads were in geography and ecology; I managed to win prizes in both subjects at the regional level several times, and in ecology,
I won at the regional level, participating in the national Olympiad in St. Petersburg in 2018. Around this time, thanks to my passion for games, I was able to master the English language.
In addition to school English lessons, I studied English extensively on my own, reading English texts and watching English videos, listening to English speech. By this age, I had already achieved a B1 level of English.
I completed my basic education with honors. By high school, when I entered secondary school, I developed an interest in mathematics, physics, and programming. The first language
I studied was Java. My graduation coincided with the coronavirus pandemic, and the last quarter all classes were distance learning, which allowed me to focus more on preparing for the Unified State Exam and hobbies.
I completed my secondary education with honors. I took the Unified State Exam and prepared for 5 subjects simultaneously, achieving moderate results in all, and high results in some.
The highest score I achieved was in English - 94 points.

## 3. University and future plans
Choosing a university for admission came with some difficulties. I had many options for admission, both in terms of fields of study and universities.
In the field of ecology, I had the opportunity to enroll in the Mining University. However, in the end, I decided to enroll in "Applied Mathematics and Informatics" at KubSU. I
justified my choice by being more familiar with Krasnodar and preferring it much more. Also, by that time, this specialty better matched my
interests and preferences. The initial experience was quite difficult - I didn't know anyone yet, and the topics taught at the university were unexpectedly complex at first.
Very soon, after careful reading, I began to gradually understand the topics, from mathematical analysis to discrete mathematics. I managed to complete the first year perfectly.
In the second year, we covered topics in web development, both frontend and backend. For assignments, we needed to complete a large personal landing page project.
While working on this project, I developed an interest in frontend development and began to study everything necessary in detail -
I studied JavaScript, CSS, the React framework, and Next.js more deeply. I graduated from the university with honors, without a single grade of four or three, in 2024. Considering the complex situation with the Bologna
system in Russia, I decided to pursue a master's degree. I passed the entrance exams better than anyone else and entered the master's program, where I could calmly work on my projects and seek employment.
In the future, I want to work as a front-end developer, although I have the skills to be a full-stack developer and develop my career. I plan to take out a mortgage in Krasnodar, buy my own car, and start a family in 5-10 years.
